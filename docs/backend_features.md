Again, I am thinking there should be a way to search for subject matter from the internal memory, and continue with those conversation or update them and refine further.
Ability to index and search the memory and update the multi-turn of the events

Senior Dev Analysis: Agent Correction, Context, and Status Update
1. Problem Recap
The agent gives a general legal answer, but sometimes suggests irrelevant next steps (e.g., "draft a demand letter" for a hit-and-run).
In real legal workflows, the user should be able to:
Refine or correct the agent's steps in a chat (e.g., "No, I don't want a demand letter, I want to attach a medical report and proceed with a claim.")
Update the agent's context/status as new information or documents are provided.
Have the agent remember the conversation and adapt its recommendations accordingly.
2. Root Causes
The agent's intent detection and tool selection are based on a single message, not a true multi-turn chat with evolving context.
There is no mechanism for the user to "correct" the agent or provide new context (e.g., uploading a medical report, clarifying intent).
The agent's memory is not being used to track workflow status, uploaded documents, or user corrections.
Implementation Plan (Step-by-Step)
A. Design the Chat/Correction Flow
Multi-Turn Chat API
Allow the user to send a sequence of messages (not just one-off questions).
Each message can be a question, correction, or new context (e.g., "Here is the medical report", "I want to file a claim, not send a demand letter").
Context/Status Update
Allow the user to attach files or structured data (e.g., medical report, police abstract) to the conversation.
Store these in the agent's memory/context.
Agent Memory and Workflow State
Use the agent's memory to track the conversation, uploaded documents, and workflow status.
The agent should reference previous steps and adapt its recommendations.
Correction/Refinement
If the agent suggests an irrelevant step, the user can reply/correct (e.g., "No, I want to file a claim, not send a demand letter").
The agent should acknowledge the correction and update its workflow.
B. Implementation Steps
API Changes
Add a /agent/chat endpoint that accepts a message, optional context, and a conversation/session ID.
Each call appends to the conversation and returns the agent's next step.
Frontend Changes
Implement a chat UI that shows the conversation history, allows file uploads, and lets the user send corrections or new context.
Allow the user to attach files (e.g., medical report) at any point.
Agent/Backend Changes
Use the agent's memory to store and retrieve the conversation, context, and uploaded files.
Update intent detection to consider the full conversation, not just the latest message.
Add logic for the agent to acknowledge corrections and update its workflow.
Testing
Test with a real chat: start with a general question, correct the agent, upload a document, and see if the agent adapts.
Ensure the agent never suggests irrelevant steps after correction.
C. Example Chat Flow
User: "A friend just been involved in a hit and run along Kenyatta Road. How do I proceed?"
Agent: "Report to police, seek medical attention, gather evidence, ... If you need help drafting a demand letter..."
User: "No, I don't want a demand letter. I want to file a claim and I have a medical report to attach."
Agent: "Understood. Please upload the medical report. Next, file a claim with the Motor Vehicle Accident Compensation Fund. Here are the steps..."
Next Steps
Implement /agent/chat endpoint with session/memory support.
Update agent logic to use full conversation and context.
Update frontend to support chat, corrections, and file uploads.
Test the full workflow end-to-end.
Proceeding to implement the backend /agent/chat endpoint and memory/session support, then will test and iterate.
Root Cause:
backend/main.py only defines the FastAPI app; it does not include a __main__ block to run the server when executed as a script.
Running python -m backend.main does not start the server, so nothing is listening on port 8000.
Only uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 will start the server, but if uvicorn fails (e.g., due to import/module issues), the API will not be available.
Senior Dev Solution
1. Add a __main__ Block to backend/main.py
This allows you to run python backend/main.py or python -m backend.main and have the server start automatically, which is robust for local development and debugging.
2. Ensure Only One Server Process Is Running
Stop all previous uvicorn/python processes before starting a new one.
3. Test the /agent/chat Endpoint
Proceeding to add the __main__ block and then start the server and test.
Root Cause:
There is a circular import between backend/api/services/agent_service.py and backend/api/endpoints/agent.py:
agent_service.py imports AgentChatRequest from agent.py
agent.py imports AgentService from agent_service.py
This prevents the backend from starting, so the API is not available.
Senior Dev Solution
1. Move AgentChatRequest to the Models File
Move the AgentChatRequest Pydantic model from endpoints/agent.py to models/agent.py.
Update all imports to use the model from models/agent.py.
This breaks the circular dependency and allows the backend to start.
2. Restart the Backend and Test
Proceeding to move the model and update imports, then restart and test.
