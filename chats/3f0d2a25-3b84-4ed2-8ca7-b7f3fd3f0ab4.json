Immediate Steps:\n   - Ensure safety and seek medical attention for any injuries.\n   - Preserve evidence: note the vehicle’s details (registration, color, make), take photos, and collect witness contacts.\n   - Report the accident to the nearest police station within 24 hours (as per Section 73 of the Traffic Act, Cap 403).\n   - Obtain a police abstract report, which is essential for insurance and legal claims.\n   - Notify your insurance company as soon as possible, providing all details and the police abstract (Section 10, Insurance (Motor Vehicles Third Party Risks) Act, Cap 405).\n\n2. Legal Framework:\n   - Key statutes: Traffic Act (Cap 403), Penal Code (Cap 63), and Insurance (Motor Vehicles Third Party Risks) Act (Cap 405).\n   - Failing to stop and report is an offence under Section 75 of the Traffic Act.\n   - If the driver is unknown, you may claim from the Insurance Compensation Fund.\n\n3.
